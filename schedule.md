Components of a research sprint

There are five essential components of a research sprint.

1. A set of questions and assumptions. 
2. Intentional and selective recruiting. You’ll need to carefully recruit people based on your goals: existing customers, prospective customers, representative customers, etc. 
3. A realistic prototype you can test. 
4. Five 1-on-1 60-minute interviews (Plus, Jakob Nielsen approves.) 
5. Real-time summarization of findings. 

A research sprint takes four days.

Day 1 (~4 hours)

Start recruiting participants

Define your criteria
Write screener questions

* Create a recruiting screener (questionnaire)
* Post recruiting screener where the right people will see it and fill it out.
 
* Set a tight deadline
* Talk to the right people

Craigslist
Finding friendlies
Experts and hard-to-find participants

DIY: Share links to:
* Craigslist
* Add to product, emails
* Append to all comms
* Friends and family
* Twitter, FB, LinkedIn, ect
* Local associations
* Community groups
* Conferences
* Student groups

Day 2 (~4 hours)

* Select and schedule participants.
* Start creating interview guide.

Start drafting interview guide

1. Introduction
2. Context questions

Day 3 (~4 hours)

* Finalize schedule and confirm participants.
* Complete interview guide.
* Review prototype with your team.

3. Tasks

What features and tasks do you want to test?

* Understanding the value proposition
* Creating an account
* Getting started with the product
* Answering questions or getting unstuck
* Completing checkout
* Changing a setting or configuring the product

Task instructions

4. Follow-up questions
5. Debrief

Build an arc
Final review: time budget and leading questions

Day 4 (~8 hours)

Interview participants and summarize findings 

* Set up the room
* Set up test devices and recording system.

Identify Design Problem (product/feature)

Schedule the Design Sprint (5-day process)

Find a facilitator

Schedule User Study/Begin recruiting ssers

Only need 1 person; Optionally, include:
* Designer
* CEO 
* Product manager
* User expert 
* Engineer
* Marketer
* Anybody else who’s interested

Supplies:
* Sticky notes 
* Drawing pens 
* Whiteboards 
* Whiteboard markers
* Dot stickers 
* Time Timer Clock 
* Snacks 
* Sticky stuff  

Day 1: Understanding Day

Consider capping presentation/discussion at 10 minutes

* Business opportunity 
* Lightning demos 
* Lay it out 
* Success metrics — We like to use Kerry Rodden’s HEART framework.
* Existing research 
* Team interviews
* Analytics

Can do User Studies/Microstudies/Team Interviews ahead of time if needed

Sketch the most important user story (as a group) = visual map

Example user stories:

Helping people understand and get started with your product

Creating a new product concept — "imagine the value proposition and core features for an engaged user"

Improving conversion rate from a landing page — "understand why people land on your page and what their goals are"

"Choose which ideas to move forward"

"Frame the discussion"

"At the end of the sprint, when you show your prototype to users, what do you hope to learn? What do you need to design and prototype in order to learn those things?"

"It’s also important to ask seemingly obvious questions"

Day 2: Diverge Day

"Rapidly developing as many solutions as possible"

"Concept sketches"

Paper first

1. Choose part of the problem (divide up user story)
2. Take notes (5 minutes) "how might we"
3. Mind map (10–15 minutes)
4. Crazy Eights (5 minutes)
5. Storyboard (10–20 minutes)

Make it stand alone 

Keep it anonymous 

Give it a name 

Hang them on the wall 

6. Silent critique (5–10 minutes)
7. Three-minute critiques (3 minutes per idea)
8. Super vote (5 minutes)
9. Repeat

Day 3: Decide Day

Combat the group effect

Search for conflicts

Best shot or battle royale?

Test your assumptions

Whiteboard the user story (comic book frames)

Keep the gloves off


Day 4: Prototype Day

"You’re going to create a real-looking version of yesterday’s storyboard and show it to users tomorrow."

Make it minimally real

Write real text

Keynote versus code

Divide and conquer

Build an asset library

Use a timer to maintain focus

Appoint an email sheriff

Lightning critique

Review with an outsider

Pointers, text, and other final touches

When Keynote isn’t enough

It’s OK if you’re not satisfied, Michelangelo

Day 5: Validate

Conduct User Study

Before the first session: List your key questions

"Review your conflicts and assumptions."

"Are you testing multiple prototypes in a battle royale?"

"Consider showing participants some real products for comparison — they’re like free prototypes!"

Set up the observation room

Test the A/V ahead of time

Don’t diss the user

Every observer takes notes

Designate a court reporter

Make a scoreboard

"Observing humans: the emotional roller coaster"

First session: “We’re geniuses!” or “We’re idiots!”
Sessions 2–4: “Oh, this is complicated…”

Studies 5-6: “There’s a pattern!”

"Now make two lists on the whiteboard: “things that work” and “problems to solve.”"

How to start your next sprint

A. Most stuff worked

"What to do next: Tune your existing prototype and keep going. Try starting your next sprint at step 3 (decide)."

B. Some big questions

"Mixed bag: a few hits, a few tweaks, and a couple of real head-scratchers"

"You can move fast on the tweaks, but you’ll want to come up with multiple solutions for the bigger problems. Start your next sprint at step 2 (diverge)."

C. Everything exploded

"Start your next sprint back at the drawing board with step 1 (understand). (Hint: the results of this study are perfect fodder for reviewing and building understanding as a group.)"

"A clear list of what to do next"
