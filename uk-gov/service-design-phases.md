# Service Design Phases

## Discovery Phase

Objectives

* workshops
* simple mock ups
* paper prototypes
* plenty of whiteboard diagrams

The team
* A small team will be required, consisting of your stakeholders and any core team members that have been identified, including the service manager.

Timescales
* The phase should not take longer than 4 to 8 weeks. During the final week you should be setting up the broad scope of a project and an initial set of user stories (also known as a backlog) to work to. This is known as an ‘inception’. At the end of the phase a decision should be made whether to proceed to the alpha phase.

Outputs
* a prioritised list of user needs
* a prioritised list of story cards to feed into project teams
* understanding of team and capability required to complete the project
* ability to scope and plan an alpha
* a decision to progress to next phase
* maybe some rough prototypes
* maybe some user personas
* a list of stakeholders and input from them about existing services
* understanding of existing services, including those run by non-government sources
* understanding of how many of your users will need assisted digital support, and what their user needs are

## Alpha Phase

Outputs
* high level story cards
* plan for beta and running of the live service (decreasingly detailed)
* working basic system that provides limited functionality that can be shown to a number of users
* understanding around legacy systems to replace or wrap or integrate with
* cross-functional requirements
* decision to progress to beta phase
* final analysis on the research you have commissioned on user needs
* options for the assisted digital support for your service
