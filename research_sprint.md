* Will people find my product useful? 
* Can people use my product?"
* Research makes great design possible
* Why research sprints are so important
* What can you learn from research sprints?
* What problems, needs, and motivations do people have?
* How do people evaluate and adopt products?
* Do people understand your product’s value proposition?
* Which messages are most effective at explaining your product?

Components of a research sprint

There are five essential components of a research sprint.

1. A set of questions and assumptions. 
2. Intentional and selective recruiting. 
3. A realistic prototype you can test. 
4. Five 1-on-1 60-minute interviews 
5. Real-time summarization of findings. 

A research sprint takes four days.
Begin Design Sprint simultaneously

Day 1 (~4 hours)

Schedule User Study (at least 3 business days into future; avoid Monday an holiday); Set a tight deadline
Start recruiting participants

Define your user criteria (favorable/unfavorable)
Write screener questions

* Create a recruiting screener (Google Forms questionnaire)
* Post recruiting screener where the right people will see it and fill it out.
 
* Talk to the right people

DIY: Share links to:
* Craigslist “Et cetera jobs” section with a link to the screener
* Add to product, emails
* Append to all comms
* Friends and family
* Twitter, FB, LinkedIn, ect
* Local associations
* Community groups
* Conferences
* Student groups

Finding friendlies: "Twitter, Facebook, or anywhere else you have an audience. You can also add a small link (“Want to give us more feedback?”) to your product, website, or company emails."

Experts and hard-to-find participants

"Check with your sales or business-development teams to see if they have lists of potential customers (leads), partners, or contacts they can share. I’ve used this approach to recruit medical specialists, small-business owners, job candidates, and many others."

"You can also look for contacts in professional associations, community groups, student groups, or your personal network." 

Day 2 (~4 hours)

* Select and schedule participants.
* Start creating interview guide.

Start drafting interview guide

1. Introduction
2. Context questions

See FitStar example context questions

Select 5 people who fit criteria

Call them on the phone

* Verify responses
* Confirm availability
* Establish rapport

Follow up email: confirm the time, date, and location of the interview. Include:

* "Any instructions that will help people arrive on time, such as directions, parking info, the nearest transit stop, and what to do when they arrive."
* "Your phone number in case they have questions or need to reschedule."
* "A link to a non-disclosure agreement that people can review and sign ahead of time. You can use DocuSign or HelloSign for online signatures, or else just attach a PDF. (In addition to confidentiality, this sample NDA gets permission to record and protects ownership of ideas)."
* "To minimize frustrating no-shows, ask people to reply to confirm. Your email subject line could say: “Reply to Confirm — Usability session scheduled on May 10 at 1 pm.”

Day 3 (~4 hours)

* Finalize schedule and confirm participants.
* Complete interview guide.
* Review prototype with your team.

* "You should have a full day of five interviews planned."
* "Call each participant to confirm (unless you just spoke with them, of course) the time and place." 
* "Send out the schedule to your team." 
* "Buy the gift cards or other incentive you’re planning to give participants."

3. Tasks

What features and tasks do you want to test?

"Make a list of the important features and tasks in your product. Which ones are critical to test in this research sprint? You can also think of these as the specific parts of the product or prototype that you want users to visit during the interview. For example, these might include:"

* Understanding the value proposition
* Creating an account
* Getting started with the product
* Answering questions or getting unstuck
* Completing checkout
* Changing a setting or configuring the product

* "Test a getting-started experience with people from the target audience who haven’t used your product."
* "Test engagement or activation with users who signed up but don’t actively use your product."
* "Test task completion or usability with people who use (or would use) the feature you are designing."

Task instructions

4. Follow-up questions (somewhat improvised)
5. Debrief

Build an arc (see infographic)
Final review: time budget and leading questions

"Consider running a pilot interview to test your guide and the timing"
