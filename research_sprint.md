Components of a research sprint

There are five essential components of a research sprint.

1. A set of questions and assumptions. 
2. Intentional and selective recruiting. You’ll need to carefully recruit people based on your goals: existing customers, prospective customers, representative customers, etc. 
3. A realistic prototype you can test. 
4. Five 1-on-1 60-minute interviews (Plus, Jakob Nielsen approves.) 
5. Real-time summarization of findings.
