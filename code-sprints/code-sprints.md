# Code Sprints

## Project Analysis and Design

Inspiration from Zed A. Shaw's [Learn Python the Hard Way- Exercise 43: Basic Object-Oriented Analysis and Design](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex43.html) and Django Girls Tutorial [Django Models Section](http://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/django_models/index.html)

Zed A. Shaw's Top-Down Process

    1. Write or draw about the problem.
    2. Extract key concepts from 1 and research them.
    3. Create a class hierarchy and object map for the concepts.
    4. Code the classes and a test to run them.
    5. Repeat and refine.

Zed A. Shaw's Bottom-Up Process

    1. Take a small piece of the problem; hack on some code and get it to run barely.
    2. Refine the code into something more formal with classes and automated tests.
    3. Extract the key concepts you're using and try to find research for them.
    4. Write a description of what's really going on.
    5. Go back and refine the code, possibly throwing it out and starting over.
    6. Repeat, moving on to some other piece of the problem.
