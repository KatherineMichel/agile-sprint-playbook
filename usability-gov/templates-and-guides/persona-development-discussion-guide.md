# Persona Development Discussion Guide

Overview
The purpose of personas is to provide a reliable representation of your key audience segments for reference.  The following questions and areas of discussion will help you construct a “picture” of the visitors to your site.

This is broad list of topics for discussion which may, of course, be added to or amended as your team or project needs. Consider these to be questions to be repeated as you discuss each user type.  

For any given project, it is advisable to limit yourself to the main audiences for the site, and only 3 or 4 of them at best. The more personas you have the more granular the population you are working toward supporting.  It is better to paint with a broad brush and meet the needs of the larger populations than try to meet the needs of everyone.
