## Sprint Summary: Where we came from
Example: “We began the design sprint with a product and business concept that
had yet to be fleshed out with customer and market research, an investigation of
potential business models, and prototypes with which to test the potential
customer in order to validate the product’s value. While we initially had some
ideas of what to build, we lacked a specific vision for how to harness software
to 1) solve the main problem of planning a wedding and 2) sustain a viable
business by optimizing its engagement with customers.”

## Sprint Summary:  What we got to
Example: “By the end of the Sprint, we had developed a clearer product vision and better
understanding of the problem and our potential customers: the core problem is
that for potential brides, grooms, and their loved ones, the experience of
planning a wedding is stressful because of the lack of organized planning
information available and because of the frictioned process of finding the right
venue.

We analysed the existing wedding planning market and existing products in a
competitive analysis of similar websites and products to understand how Great
Engagements can differentiate itself from its competitors to create a product
that provides customer value, generates customer engagement, and profits from
revenue. 

In trying to accomplish our goals of solving the customer’s wedding planning
problem through software that generates revenue, we identified the riskiest
assumptions and knowledge gaps we have during this process and validated those
assumptions in the prototype and user-testing phase. We also identified several
potentially viable business models and revenue streams to work towards
validating. We consider it possible to generate revenue through customer premium
subscription accounts.

To reflect our insights and test our assumptions, we built a simple prototype
and tested it with individuals in and close to our target market and were able
to get positive validation of the assumptions we intended to test.”

## Sprint Summary: Major learnings/take aways

Example:

* We need to do further research on the viability of potential revenue streams
  * subscriptions
  * premium services (will people pay for these?)
    * full service venue visit planning/booking (make it a date!)
    * communication tools
    * wedding planning counselor/therapist
  * lead generation
  * referral bonuses
  * venue listing (charge venues to list their venue)
* We need to do further research on how we might source venues and venue info & photos
* Form the Prototype
  * The simple Madlib style form is engaging and makes sense.
  * People understood what Great Engagements is about (finding venues)
  * The large imagery and theme concept resonated with people and they found it
    more straightforward and inviting than  existing and popular wedding
    planning sites.

## Sprint Summary: Where to go next

Next steps following the design sprint:

Example:

* Address the remaining unknowns and assumptions through low-cost (consider time
  as well) research and interviews.
* Validate the primary value hypothesis; create a prototype of the venue page
  with an improved display and organization of planning information valuable for
  customers who have had/have trouble finding pertinent wedding-related
  information online.
* Refine the prototype to incorporate an email sign-up feature, host it live
  online, and drive traffic to the landing page to gauge public interest in the
  current landing page.
