# Pre-sprint

### Send out [Client Worksheet](Materials/Pre-Sprint_Client_Worksheet.md) and [Request for Materials](Materials/Pre-Sprint_Request_for_Materials.md)

Notify all members of the sprint to set up the expectation of anything that they
need to complete before the sprint and what to expect during the sprint.

### Review roles for the sprint

**Facilitator** Leads the design sprint. Guides the sprint from start to
completion.

**Recorder** Takes notes, photographs and is in charge of the documentation for
the sprint.

**Product Owner** Typically the client and the person with the initial product vision. 
This person has final say in the product.

### Set expectations for the outcome for the sprint

Sometimes, design sprints converge on solutions that are
partially or completely invalidated.
Some things will have worked, and others won't.
Make sure everyone understands that the outcome
falls in one of three buckets:

- Most stuff worked

This often doesn't happen during the first sprint on a project,
but if it happens to you,
everyone on the team is probably on the same page about the fixes and
tweaks you need to make.

What to do next: Take a week to tune your existing prototype. Create a backlog
for developers to start implementation of the most important features or API
integrations.

- Some big questions

A common outcome after a user study is a mixed bag: a few hits, a few
tweaks, and a couple of real head-scratchers. Fortunately Keynote prototypes are
easy to change, and as long as some parts of your design are solid, you can
probably build on what you have.

What to do next: You can move fast on the tweaks, but you’ll want to come up
with multiple solutions for the bigger problems. Start your next sprint at step
2 (diverge).

- Everything exploded

We've seen a lot of designs go up in flames, and that's OK. You learned that
something didn’t work, and it only took you a few hours to build it.
This is great progress, and very cheap relative to building 
and launching a full product.
Think what would have happened if you’d spent weeks or
months implementing this solution!

What to do next: Start your next sprint back at the drawing board with step 1 (understand). (Hint: the results of this study are perfect fodder for reviewing and building understanding as a group.)

### Review design sprint documentation and schedule

The moderator of the sprint should be reviewing design sprint documentation and
coming up with a plan specific to the project of feature set. **Typically done by the Facilitator.**


### Gather existing research and information

Learning from previous product design sprints, existing product or other test
and research done. **Typically done by the Product Owner.**

### Capture existing competition

Any potential competition that solves the same or similar problem that the
sprint is trying to solve. This should include lowest common denominator
competitors such as email and offline tools. **Typically done by the Product Owner.**

### Set up room

Make sure you have a room big enough to fit all of the people in the sprint. The
room would have a whiteboard and a place to pin or tape up sketches. **Typically done by Facilitator.**

### Buy supplies needed for sprint

* Sharpies
* Post-its
* Blank sheets of Printer paper
* Whiteboard markers
* Circle vote stickers
* Easel Pad
 
**Typically done by Facilitator.**

### Schedule 4–6 people for interviews / usability tests

Only if users are already identified. Otherwise this should be held off till
after Understand. During [Test](../5-Test), we'll be running a user study, showing the
prototype to 4–6 real people. Learn [how to recruit great participants for your study
here](http://www.designstaff.org/articles/recruiting-how-to-find-great-participants-for-your-user-study-2012-02-22.html).
**Typically done by Product Owner.**
