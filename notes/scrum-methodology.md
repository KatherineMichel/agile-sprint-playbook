11.1.2.2 Four Questions per Team*
Each Scrum Team representative will provide updates from his or her team in turn. These updates are usually provided in the form of answers to four specific questions.
1) What has my team been working on since the last meeting?
2) What will my team do until the next meeting?
3) What were other teams counting on our team to finish that remains undone?
4) What is our team planning on doing that might affect other teams?

## General

Principles
2.2 Roles Guide: Scrum Core Team Roles— Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Scrum Team
2.3 Empirical Process Control: three main ideas of transparency, inspection, and adaptation
2.4 Self-organization
2.5 Collaboration (and Colocated Terms vs. Distributed)
2.6 Value-based Prioritization (Value, Risk or Uncertainty, Dependencies)
2.7 Time-boxing (Scrum Time-Boxes: Sprint, Daily Standup Meeting, Sprint Planning Meeting, Sprint Review Meeting, Retrospective Sprint Meeting)

Business Justification Techniques: (Estimation of Project Value: Return on Investment (ROI), Net Present Value (NPV), Internal Rate of Return (IRR)) (Planning for Value: Value Stream Mapping, Customer Value-based Prioritization (Simple Schemes, MoSCoW Prioritization, Monopoly Money, 100-Point Method, Kano Analysis), Relative Prioritization Ranking, Story Mapping)
Continuous Value Justification: (Earned Value Analysis: Table 4-1: Earned Value Formulas, Cumulative Flow Diagram (CFD))

Scrum vs. Traditional Project Management

6. Change
Roles Guide
Overview: Unapproved and Approved Change Requests, Figure 6-1: Sample Change Approval Process
Change in Scrum: Balancing Flexibility and Stability; Achieving Flexibility; (Flexibility through Iterative Product Development: Stakeholders, Figure 6-4: Motivation of Stakeholders for Requesting Changes; Scrum Core Team, Figure 6-5: Motivation of Scrum Core Team for Requesting Changes; Senior Management, Scrum Guidance Body); Flexibility through Time-boxing; Flexibility through Cross-functional and Self-organized Teams; Flexibility through Customer Value-based Prioritization; Flexibility through Continuous Integration
Integrating Change: Changes to a Sprint, Impact of Expected Change on the Length of Sprint, Managing Changes through Prioritized Product Backlog Grooming, Effective Product Backlog Review Meeting (or Prioritized Product Backlog Grooming Session), Managing Changes During Demonstrate and Validate Sprint
Change to Programs and Portfolios: In Portfolio, In Program, 
Summary of Responsibilities: Table 6-1: Summary of Responsibilities Relevant to Change
Scrum vs. Traditional Project Management

7. Risk
Roles Guide
What is Risk?: Difference between Risks and Issues, Risk Attitude, Utility Function
Risk Management Procedure: Risk Identification, (Risk Identification Techniques: Review Lessons Learned from Retrospect Sprint or Retrospect Project Processes, Risk Checklists, Risk Prompt Lists, Brainstorming, Risk Breakdown Structure (RBS)), Risk-Based Spike, Risk Assessment, Risk Assessment Techniques (Risk Meeting, Probability Trees, Pareto Analysis, Probability Impact Grid, Expected Monetary Value (EMV)) Risk Prioritization: Figure 7-4: Process for Risk Prioritization, Risk Mitigation, Risk Communication: Risk Burndown Chart
Minimizing Risks through Scrum: Flexibility reduces business-environment-related risk, Regular feedback reduces expectations-related risk, Team ownership reduces estimation risk, Transparency reduces non-detection risk, Iterative delivery reduces investment risk
Risks in Portfolios and Programs: In Portfolio, In Program,
