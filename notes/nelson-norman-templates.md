 CONFIRMATION MESSAGE
[Sample Confirmation Message for Email, Fax, or Letter]
Hello [participant name]:
Thank you very much for agreeing to participate in the [study name] [if as a backup, say “as a backup participant” and include wording about what is expected of a backup]. As I explained when we spoke on [day], your evaluation session will be held at [facility name], [address], in [city] on [date and time]. Please plan to arrive about 10 minutes before your scheduled session time to fill in some participant forms.
Because we are scheduling very few people for this study, it is extremely important that you keep your appointment with us. If for any reason you cannot make it, or you find you will be unavoidably late, please contact [name of person who can resolve last-minute changes], at [phone number] as soon as you know. Please do not send anyone else in your place.
If you wear glasses while using the computer, please bring them with you to your session. You will use [generic description of system—remember you probably don’t want the participant to practice in advance] to do a few tasks. Then the evaluation staff will ask you a few follow-up questions to clarify their observations to ensure they thoroughly understand your actions with the [system] and obtain any additional feedback you feel is important.
At the completion of your session, you will receive [incentive] as our thanks for your participation. [unless you will be sending the incentive later. See paragraph below.]
[If you are videotaping session] I’d like to remind you that, with your permission, your session will be videotaped, and that these tapes will be used by the project team within the company for analysis purposes only; all personal information, including your identity, will remain company confidential.
[If you will administer a nondisclosure] In addition, [we, or study sponsor] need you to sign a nondisclosure agreement that says you agree not to talk to anyone about the [system] you are evaluating. You may tell them that you participated in a usability study, however.
[If you will provide a meal or refreshments] We will be providing food and beverages. The food will consist of [describe, for example, small sandwiches and cookies].
[If the incentive will not be provided at the session] We will provide [incentive, such as the next release of software] approximately four weeks after your session. We will need the address to which you would like us to send the [incentive].
[Below, or attached] is a map and driving directions to [facility]. If you have any questions, please feel free to call me at [phone number].
Regards, [Name]

 DEALING WITH UNQUALIFIED PARTICIPANTS
• Tell the job seeker: “This is a usability evaluation of [system], and not a job opportunity. We are not employment recruiters, nor do we know what employment opportunities are available at [company]. If you would like to continue with the study tasks and the evaluation, we can. If you would prefer to end the session, we can do so. We will still honor the incentive we agreed to provide.”
• Tell the incentive-only seeker: “We’d like you to focus on the tasks at hand. I assure you, you will receive the incentive we agreed to provide. Would you like to continue, or shall we end the session? We will still honor the incentive we agreed to provide.”
• Tell the competitor or spy: “Thank you very much. We’ve learned enough in the session with what you have shown us already. We’re going to let you out early.” Then provide the incentive and escort him / her out.
• Tell the verbally abusive participant: “You obviously have become unhappy with this session [or the software, or the website], so I am going to end the session now. We will still honor the incentive we agreed to provide, unless you don’t wish to receive it.” Then escort him or her out. If necessary, be prepared to call security for an escort, and do not hesitate to tell the participant that is what you are going to do should s/he become even more abusive.
• Tell the sick participant: “It appears to me that you are not feeling very well. I don’t want to impose on you any longer, nor do I wish to become ill myself. So why don’t we end the session early and let you go home for some rest? We will still honor the incentive we agreed to provide, and we thank you for making the effort to attend the session even though you’re not feeling well.
ELICITING SENSITIVE INFORMATION – SAMPLE QUESTIONS
    Avoid phrasing your questions this way:
       Instead phrase them this way:
   Age:
How old are you?
    Please tell me which of the following ranges your age falls within: 21–25 years, 26–30 years, 31–35 years, 36–40 years, more than 40 years.
   Gender:
What is your sex? [or] Are you male or female?
  It is best not to ask these questions at all. Rather, use aural cues, such a voice pitch, or visual cues, such as spelling of candidate’s name, to determine gender. If, after interviewing the candidate, you still are unsure, make note of it on the questionnaire. However, if you are prescreening with an email message, it would be acceptable to ask respondents to indicate gender.
   Employment status:
Are you employed, unemployed,
    What is your current occupation?

INTERVIEW TOPICS FOR MEETING WITH THE SYSTEM TEAM
You can elicit much of the information you need about users by asking about the users’
• Job title and job description
• Type of employer (size; retail / manufacturing / wholesale / service)
• Role regarding the system (uses it, or supports others who do)
• Frequency of use (infrequent, often, daily)
• Most-critical tasks
• Task transitions (which tasks precede or follow other tasks)
• Job benefitsusing the system to increase performance (bonuses, raises, respect)
• Environment (where system is used, how it is set up)
48105 WARM SPRINGS BLVD. FREMONT, CA 94539-7498 USA INFO@NNGROUP.COM 169
            
 • Task complexity (regarding the product or domain)
• Prior experience (with specific products, competitive, related, and
predecessor).
——End of Sample Interview Topics——
INTERVIEW QUESTIONS FOR THE SYSTEM TEAM
Using the topics listed above as a start, prepare a list of specific questions to ask the system team. More than likely, you will also ask questions that are not on your list to elicit elaboration or clarification. Both planned and follow-up questions are provided in the following table. These questions will help determine which users are affected by the study focus, which characteristics these users have, and whether you will need to recruit from several user groups.
Who uses the system?
  User Experience Specialist Questions
     System Team Responses
     Who enters issue resolutions into the system?
  Project managers.
  Would anyone else ever enter issue resolutions?
     Occasionally account reps. They have system permission to do that.
  Follow-up: How about administrative assistants? Would they ever enter a resolution for a project manager or account rep?
   Well, technically they don’t have permission, but if the PM or account rep gives them their ID and password, the admin can enter a resolution for them.
 Follow-up: Will this situation change, or will assistants always be entering resolutions unofficially?
      Based on what we know is happening, we’re going to set up permission for account reps’ and PMs’ assistants to go in there “legally.”
  Follow-up: Does anyone else besides project managers and account managers have system permissions to enter resolutions? Project team members perhaps?
    No, team members can enter a project issue, and they can suggest a resolution for an issue, but only a project manager or account manager has permission to enter the actual resolution.
  What are different users’ distinguishing characteristics?
  User Experience Specialist Questions
     System Team Responses
     Which users enter what proportion of the resolutions?
  Project managers enter 90–95% of the resolutions and account reps about 5%– 10%.
 Follow-up: Where do assistants fall in that ratio?
      In with the account reps’ 5%–10%.
   Are the calls to the help desk coming mostly
  The help desk hasn’t been asking that. They do ask for job title though, so we
           © NIELSEN NORMAN GROUP WWW.NNGROUP.COM 170
 
   User Experience Specialist Questions
     System Team Responses
    from new users or from experienced users?
  know whether they’re PMs, account reps, or admins.
     Do these users need training to use XYZ, or can those new to XYZ learn it fairly quickly?
   Well, the system is supposed to be quick and easy to learn—if you’re a certified project manager or trained account rep.
  Follow-up: So, do all the project managers who use XYZ have project management certification?
    Yes, they already have it when they’re hired, or they get certification right away through the company.
  Follow-up: And, do all your account reps receive training?
   Yes, they go through our training and orientation program as soon as they’re hired. They also go to seminars and classes whenever we add new products or services to our lines of business.
 Recap: Okay, so the users of XYZ issue- resolution are certified project managers, trained account reps, and possibly their assistants, correct?
      Correct.
   How long does it take for a user to become “experienced”? Added question (based on information volunteered by system team): You’re not sure if most of the complaints are coming from new users or experienced users, so we should include some of each in the test.
  I’d say after three months, a user should really know how the system works.
  About how many resolutions do you estimate each user enters and how often?
     It varies, of course, depending on the project and how many projects they’re working on at any one time.
  Follow-up: Go ahead and give me your best guess. When I meet with one of the PMs, I can adjust your estimate if I need to.
    Okay, I’m guessing that PMs roughly enter 8–10 resolutions per month, account reps only 3 or 4, and assistants possibly 1 or 2, maybe more, if their boss is pretty busy.
   Where do users work with XYZ; at their desk (project managers), on a laptop in the field (account managers)?
  They all work with XYZ in the office. We have plans to change to a web-based application that we’ll put up on our intranet, and then people will be able to use it wherever they can access our intranet.
 Follow-up: When will this change take place?
Note to self: check back in about six months to ask about testing the web- based version of XYZ.
      Early next year. We want to make sure issue resolution is working first.

 Opening Script
Olympia Human Factors Aztech.com Website Usability Test Participant Screening Script and Questionnaire
“Hello, may I please speak to Thomas Apollo? This is Artemis Hermes from Olympia Human Factors in San Francisco. I am calling you today because we are looking for people who might be interested in participating in a usability evaluation that we are conducting for one of our clients who is in the process of redesigning their website. Obtaining feedback from actual Web users is one of the important ways we can ensure development of a website that will be a valuable resource, as well as easy to use.
“We are looking for people in the San Francisco Bay Area who would be interested in spending about 90 minutes evaluating our client’s website and offering feedback on their experience. Olympia will use this feedback to help our client improve their website for people like you. Your input into this process would be invaluable. I assure you that I am not trying to sell you anything now or in the future.
“As thanks for your participation in the website evaluation, you’ll receive (USD) $100 at the end of your evaluation session. Does this sound like something you might be interested in?”
[If yes, continue. If no, ask if s/he may know another person who might be interested, get that person’s contact information, thank respondent for his / her time, and terminate the call.]
“Great. Sessions will take place at Diamond Focus, 123 Market Street, in San Francisco on Wednesday, January 8, and Thursday, January 9. Would a 90-minute session on one of these two days work for you?”
[If yes, continue. If no, ask if s/he may know another person who might be interested, get that person’s contact information, thank respondent for his / her time, and terminate the call.]
“If you have a few minutes, I’d like to ask you some questions to determine whether you’re an appropriate candidate for the website evaluation. Do you have time right now to answer a few questions?”
[If yes, go to Screening Questions. If no, arrange a time to call back.]
Screening Questions
Gender: [Observed only. Do not inquire.]
 Female [Accept 2–3 regulars and 1–2 backups. A woman as pilot is
acceptable.]

 Invitation
Olympia Human Factors Aztech.com Website Usability Test Participant Screening Script and Questionnaire
“Thank you very much for answering my questions. I’d like to invite you to participate in our study [if as a backup, say “as a backup participant.” If the candidate wants to know more about backup status, read the boxed backup script on the next page]. As I explained earlier, your evaluation session will be held at Diamond Focus, 123 Market Street, in San Francisco.
“If you wear glasses while using the computer, please bring them with you to your session. You will use our client’s website to do a few tasks. Then the evaluation staff will ask you a few follow-up questions to clarify their observations to ensure they thoroughly understand your actions with the site and obtain any additional feedback you feel is important. At the completion of your session, you will receive $100 as our thanks for your participation.
[If you will be videotaping session] “I’d like to let you know that your session will be video taped, but that these tapes will be used by the project team within the company for analysis purposes only; all information, including your identity, will remain confidential. At your session, we will ask you to sign a videotaping consent form.]”
[If you will administer a nondisclosure] “In addition, our client has asked that you sign a nondisclosure agreement which says that you will agree not to talk to anyone about the website you are evaluating. You may tell them that you helped to evaluate a new website, however.”
[If you will provide orientation and / or training] [Briefly explain what sort of orientation and / or training you will provide and what time commitment is needed from the participant.]
[If you will provide a meal or refreshments] [Let people know that you’ll be providing food and beverages and whether it will be substantial or simple.]
[If the incentive will not be provided at the session] [If the incentive, such as the next release of software, you will provide is not available at the time of the session, explain to the participant how and approximately when s/he will receive it.]
Can we count on your participation? If so, I’d like to schedule a tentative appointment to reserve your space in the study schedule.”
Schedule
“Because we are scheduling very few people for this study, it is extremely important that you keep your appointment with us. If for any reason you must reschedule, please contact me, [your name and phone number] as soon as you know. Please do not send anyone else in your place.”
