## Let's Identify the "Problem"

### Wanted: Answers

* What questions do you want to answer?
* What features/tasks do you want to test?

Go through the [Google Ventures Questions to Ask Before Starting User Research](http://www.gv.com/lib/questions-to-ask-before-starting-user-research) 

#### User Story Task List
#### User Story Divided into Parts

These sketches formed the basis for a [Prototype](prototype.md) that I made.

* Identify Product/Feature/Redesign Design Problem 

Types of Research Questions
* Will my product help people solve their problems? 
* What should I build?
* Do people understand my product? 
* Will people find my product useful? 
* Can people use my product?"
* Research makes great design possible
* Why research sprints are so important
* What can you learn from research sprints?
* What problems, needs, and motivations do people have?
* How do people evaluate and adopt products?
* Do people understand your product’s value proposition?
* Which messages are most effective at explaining your product?
* Can people figure out how to use your product?
* Why do people stop using your product?
* Why don’t people adopt new features when you launch them?

Components of a research sprint

There are five essential components of a research sprint.

1. A set of questions and assumptions. 
2. Intentional and selective recruiting. 
3. A realistic prototype you can test. 
4. Five 1-on-1 60-minute interviews 
5. Real-time summarization of findings. 

A research sprint takes four days.
Begin Design Sprint simultaneously

Day 1 (~4 hours)

* Countdown Checklist
* Research Plan

Schedule User Study (at least 3 business days into future; avoid Monday an holiday); Set a tight deadline
Start recruiting participants

Define your user criteria (favorable/unfavorable)
Write screener questions

* Create a recruiting screener (Google Forms questionnaire)
* Post recruiting screener where the right people will see it and fill it out.
 
* Talk to the right people

DIY: Share links to:
* Craigslist “Et cetera jobs” section with a link to the screener
* Add to product, emails
* Append to all comms
* Friends and family
* Twitter, FB, LinkedIn, ect
* Local associations
* Community groups
* Conferences
* Student groups

Finding friendlies: "Twitter, Facebook, or anywhere else you have an audience. You can also add a small link (“Want to give us more feedback?”) to your product, website, or company emails."

Experts and hard-to-find participants

"Check with your sales or business-development teams to see if they have lists of potential customers (leads), partners, or contacts they can share. I’ve used this approach to recruit medical specialists, small-business owners, job candidates, and many others."

"You can also look for contacts in professional associations, community groups, student groups, or your personal network." 

Day 2 (~4 hours)

* Select and schedule participants.
* Start creating interview guide.

Start drafting interview guide

1. Introduction
2. Context questions

See FitStar example context questions

Select 5 people who fit criteria

Call them on the phone

* Verify responses
* Confirm availability
* Establish rapport

Follow up email: confirm the time, date, and location of the interview. Include:

* "Any instructions that will help people arrive on time, such as directions, parking info, the nearest transit stop, and what to do when they arrive."
* "Your phone number in case they have questions or need to reschedule."
* "A link to a non-disclosure agreement that people can review and sign ahead of time. You can use DocuSign or HelloSign for online signatures, or else just attach a PDF. (In addition to confidentiality, this sample NDA gets permission to record and protects ownership of ideas)."
* "To minimize frustrating no-shows, ask people to reply to confirm. Your email subject line could say: “Reply to Confirm — Usability session scheduled on May 10 at 1 pm.”

Day 3 (~4 hours)

* Finalize schedule and confirm participants.
* Complete interview guide.
* Review prototype with your team. "Talk about which tasks you need to test to answer your questions or validate your assumptions"

* "You should have a full day of five interviews planned."
* "Call each participant to confirm (unless you just spoke with them, of course) the time and place." 
* "Send out the schedule to your team." 
* "Buy the gift cards or other incentive you’re planning to give participants."

3. Tasks (task-based testing)
 
"You can do task-based testing with almost any kind of prototype, as long as it looks real: a few mockups, a clickable prototype, your actual product, or even a competitor’s product."

What features and tasks do you want to test?

"Make a list of the important features and tasks in your product. Which ones are critical to test in this research sprint? You can also think of these as the specific parts of the product or prototype that you want users to visit during the interview. For example, these might include:"

* Understanding the value proposition
* Creating an account
* Getting started with the product
* Answering questions or getting unstuck
* Completing checkout
* Changing a setting or configuring the product

* "Test a getting-started experience with people from the target audience who haven’t used your product."
* "Test engagement or activation with users who signed up but don’t actively use your product."
* "Test task completion or usability with people who use (or would use) the feature you are designing."

Task instructions

4. Follow-up questions (somewhat improvised)
5. Debrief

Build an arc (see infographic)
Final review: time budget and leading questions

"Consider running a pilot interview to test your guide and the timing"

See "User Study" Chapter for Day 4

A Design Sprint takes 5 days.

* Identify Product/Feature/Redesign Design Problem 
* Schedule the Design Sprint
* Begin Research Sprint simultaneously
* Find a facilitator

"They (facilitator) need to be confident leading a meeting, including synthesizing discussions and telling people it’s time to stop talking."

Only need 1 person; Optionally, include:
* Designer
* CEO (buy-in/decision-maker)
* Product manager
* User expert 
* Engineer
* Marketer
* Anybody else who’s interested

"It’s also very important to have a dedicated room for the duration of the sprint, usually a conference room with lots of whiteboards."

Supplies:
* Sticky stuff: "You’ll need to stick your drawings and storyboards on the wall."

Day 1: Understanding Day

Consider capping presentation/discussion at 10 minutes

* Business opportunity 
* Lightning demos 
* Lay it out 
* Success metrics — Ex. Kerry Rodden’s HEART framework.
* Existing research 
* Team interviews
* Analytics

Can do User Studies/Microstudies/Team Interviews ahead of time if needed

Sketch the most important user story (as a group) = visual map

Example user stories:
* Helping people understand and get started with your product
* Creating a new product concept — "imagine the value proposition and core features for an engaged user"
* Improving conversion rate from a landing page — "understand why people land on your page and what their goals are"

"Choose which ideas to move forward"

"Frame the discussion"

"At the end of the sprint, when you show your prototype to users, what do you hope to learn? What do you need to design and prototype in order to learn those things?"

"It’s also important to ask seemingly obvious questions"

Day 2: Diverge Day

"Rapidly developing as many solutions as possible"

"Concept sketches"

Paper first

1. Choose part of the problem (divide up user story)
2. Take notes (5 minutes) "how might we"
3. Mind map (10–15 minutes)
4. Crazy Eights (5 minutes)
5. Storyboard (10–20 minutes)

* Make it stand alone 
* Keep it anonymous 
* Give it a name 
* Hang them on the wall 

6. Silent critique (5–10 minutes)
7. Three-minute critiques (3 minutes per idea)
8. Super vote (5 minutes)
9. Repeat

Day 3: Decide Day

* Combat the group effect
* Search for conflicts
* Best shot or battle royale?
* Test your assumptions
* Whiteboard the user story (comic book frames)
* Keep the gloves off

Day 4: Prototype Day

"You’re going to create a real-looking version of yesterday’s storyboard and show it to users tomorrow."
* Make it minimally real
* Write real text
* Keynote versus code
* Divide and conquer
* Build an asset library
* Use a timer to maintain focus
* Appoint an email sheriff
* Lightning critique
* Review with an outsider
* Pointers, text, and other final touches
* When Keynote isn’t enough
* It’s OK if you’re not satisfied, Michelangelo

Research Sprint Day 4 (~8 hours)

Conduct User Study
Interview participants and summarize findings 

* Set up the observation room
* Set up test devices and recording system.
* Test desktop prototypes
* Test mobile prototypes
* Prepare your team to watch the interviews
* Get into character
* Showtime: Interview five customers!
* Summarize findings, review and plan next steps with your team.

"Your interviews will help you answer big questions, test your assumptions, and figure out what to do next."

Set up the room
Before participants arrive, use this checklist to prepare:

* Print copies of the non-disclosure agreement (in case participants did not e-sign).
* Print your interview guide (for your reference).
* Clean up the interview room: erase whiteboards, throw out empty coffee cups, etc.
* Post “do not disturb” sign on the door of the room.
* Gather incentives for participants (gift cards, etc).
* Grab a notepad and pens for any short notes you want to take. (But your team will handle the bulk of the notetaking.)
* Make sure there’s a clock on the wall or table.
Put a box of tissues in the room, just in case.

Testing desktop prototypes

* Test video streaming and recording.
* If using GoToMeeting, schedule a “meeting” for each interview. Add the meeting URLs and phone numbers to your team’s calendar.
* Install the prototypes and do a test run. (Be sure to revert prototypes to their default state before the interviews.)
* Hide obvious personal information and remove desktop icons from computer. (desktop only)
* Clear web browser history, cookies, cache, and bookmarks.
* Create bookmarks or shortcuts for prototypes.
* Set an innocuous home page (e.g. your local newspaper). (desktop only)
* Minimize the browser or prototypes until you’re ready for your participants to test them. 
* Wipe down the keyboard, mouse, and display.

In addition to the above, for Testing mobile prototypes

* Close the browser or prototypes until you’re ready for your participants to test them.
* Open the IPEVO Presenter app on the computer.
* Position the Ziggi document camera so it’s focused on the test device.
* Position the webcam so it’s focused on the participant’s face.

Prepare your team to watch the interviews

* Grab plenty of snacks and drinks so they don’t have to step out during the interviews.
* Test the audio and video before the interviews begin.
* Mute their microphone (and video camera, if necessary) so participants don’t get nervous about being watched.
* Assign one note-taker to write detailed, transcript-style notes — and rotate so no one is stuck typing for five hours!
* Stock up on Post-It notes, notepads, pens, and whiteboard markers.
* Pay attention and write down observations, insights, and ideas during the interviews.
* Keep laptops closed and phones put away during the interviews.
* Collect insights and ideas after each interview, so it doesn’t all pile up at the end of the day.
* Have fun and keep an open mind!
* Design Sprint Day 5: Validate

Before the first session: List your key questions

"Review your conflicts and assumptions."

"Are you testing multiple prototypes in a battle royale?"

"Consider showing participants some real products for comparison — they’re like free prototypes!"

Test the A/V ahead of time
Don’t diss the user
Every observer takes notes
Designate a court reporter
Make a scoreboard

"Observing humans: the emotional roller coaster"
First session: “We’re geniuses!” or “We’re idiots!”
Sessions 2–4: “Oh, this is complicated…”
Studies 5-6: “There’s a pattern!”
"Now make two lists on the whiteboard: “things that work” and “problems to solve.”"
How to start your next sprint
A. Most stuff worked
"What to do next: Tune your existing prototype and keep going. Try starting your next sprint at step 3 (decide)."
B. Some big questions
"Mixed bag: a few hits, a few tweaks, and a couple of real head-scratchers"
"You can move fast on the tweaks, but you’ll want to come up with multiple solutions for the bigger problems. Start your next sprint at step 2 (diverge)."
C. Everything exploded
"Start your next sprint back at the drawing board with step 1 (understand). (Hint: the results of this study are perfect fodder for reviewing and building understanding as a group.)"
"A clear list of what to do next"
