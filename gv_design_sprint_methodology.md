# Design Sprint
A Design Sprint takes 5 days. The Research Sprint begins simultaneously. 

* Identify Product/Feature/Redesign Design Problem 

## People and Supplies

### People 
Only need 1 person; Optionally, include:
* Facilitator
* Designer
* CEO (buy-in/decision-maker)
* Product manager
* User expert 
* Engineer
* Marketer
* Anybody else who’s interested

"They (facilitator) need to be confident leading a meeting, including synthesizing discussions and telling people it’s time to stop talking."

### Supplies:
* Paper
* Sticky notes 
* Drawing pens 
* Whiteboard
* Whiteboard markers
* Dot stickers (for voting)
* Sticky stuff
* Timer 
* Snacks 

* And a working space  

"It’s also very important to have a dedicated room for the duration of the sprint, usually a conference room with lots of whiteboards."

## Day 1: Understanding Day

Consider capping presentation/discussion at 10 minutes

* Business opportunity 
* Lightning demos 
* Lay it out 
* Success metrics — Ex. Kerry Rodden’s HEART framework.
* Existing research 
* Team interviews
* Analytics

Can do User Studies/Microstudies/Team Interviews ahead of time if needed

Sketch the most important user story (as a group) = visual map

Example user stories:
* Helping people understand and get started with your product
* Creating a new product concept — "imagine the value proposition and core features for an engaged user"
* Improving conversion rate from a landing page — "understand why people land on your page and what their goals are"

"Choose which ideas to move forward"

"Frame the discussion"

"At the end of the sprint, when you show your prototype to users, what do you hope to learn? What do you need to design and prototype in order to learn those things?"

"It’s also important to ask seemingly obvious questions"

## Day 2: Diverge Day

"Rapidly developing as many solutions as possible"

"Concept sketches"

Paper first

1. Choose part of the problem (divide up user story)
2. Take notes (5 minutes) "how might we"
3. Mind map (10–15 minutes)
4. Crazy Eights (5 minutes)
5. Storyboard (10–20 minutes)

* Make it stand alone 
* Keep it anonymous 
* Give it a name 
* Hang them on the wall 

6. Silent critique (5–10 minutes)
7. Three-minute critiques (3 minutes per idea)
8. Super vote (5 minutes)
9. Repeat

## Day 3: Decide Day

* Combat the group effect
* Search for conflicts
* Best shot or battle royale?
* Test your assumptions
* Whiteboard the user story (comic book frames)
* Keep the gloves off

## Day 4: Prototype Day

"You’re going to create a real-looking version of yesterday’s storyboard and show it to users tomorrow."
* Make it minimally real
* Write real text
* Keynote versus code
* Divide and conquer
* Build an asset library
* Use a timer to maintain focus
* Appoint an email sheriff
* Lightning critique
* Review with an outsider
* Pointers, text, and other final touches
* When Keynote isn’t enough
* It’s OK if you’re not satisfied, Michelangelo
