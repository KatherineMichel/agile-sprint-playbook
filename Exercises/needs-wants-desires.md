# Needs, Wants, Desires

**Supplies needed:** Post-its, Sharpie, Whiteboard

**Estimated time:** 30 min

## Best to use when

Needs, Wants, Desires is a [Card Sorting](card-sorting.md)
exercise to help figure out priorities.
It's best to use when there are a lot of feature ideas
being thrown around when there isn't a good sense of which is the most
important.

## Instructions:

1. List outfeature ideas on Post-its.
* Divide up the whiteboard into 3 sections: Needs, Wants, and Desires
* For the first feature, 
add it to *Needs* if it is critical to the job to be done,
*Wants* if it is supplemental to the main job to be done,
*Desires* if it outside of the main job to be done.
It is best to reflect on the [Problem Statement](problem-statement.md)
while doing this.
* Repeat for each of the remaining ideas.
* Once all of the features are sorted, 
look at each section and the features in them
and verify that each feature in is the appropriate section.
