# User Study

Research Sprint Day 4 (~8 hours)

Conduct User Study
Interview participants and summarize findings 

* Set up the observation room
* Set up test devices and recording system.
* Test desktop prototypes
* Test mobile prototypes
* Prepare your team to watch the interviews
* Get into character
* Showtime: Interview five customers!
* Summarize findings, review and plan next steps with your team.


Design Sprint Day 5: Validate

Before the first session: List your key questions

"Review your conflicts and assumptions."

"Are you testing multiple prototypes in a battle royale?"

"Consider showing participants some real products for comparison — they’re like free prototypes!"

Test the A/V ahead of time
Don’t diss the user
Every observer takes notes
Designate a court reporter
Make a scoreboard

"Observing humans: the emotional roller coaster"

First session: “We’re geniuses!” or “We’re idiots!”
Sessions 2–4: “Oh, this is complicated…”

Studies 5-6: “There’s a pattern!”

"Now make two lists on the whiteboard: “things that work” and “problems to solve.”"

How to start your next sprint

A. Most stuff worked

"What to do next: Tune your existing prototype and keep going. Try starting your next sprint at step 3 (decide)."

B. Some big questions

"Mixed bag: a few hits, a few tweaks, and a couple of real head-scratchers"

"You can move fast on the tweaks, but you’ll want to come up with multiple solutions for the bigger problems. Start your next sprint at step 2 (diverge)."

C. Everything exploded

"Start your next sprint back at the drawing board with step 1 (understand). (Hint: the results of this study are perfect fodder for reviewing and building understanding as a group.)"
