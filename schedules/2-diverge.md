## Example Schedule for Diverge

### Intro to Day 2: Diverge *(5min)*

### Guidelines

Everyone participates, you don’t need to be an artist (I’m not!) to sketch and
visualize your ideas. No ideas are too wild!

### [Pitch Practice](../Exercises/pitch-practice.md) *(10min)*

### Recap Day 1, identify biggest risks, determine goals for the prototype *(45min)*

### Identify and diagram the critical path for the prototype *(45min)*

Write down the user story that is most important for this sprint or that best
addresses our most blocking/risky assumptions/knowledge gaps. (Write the story
    as if you were the ‘user’). Diagram the critical path, and break it into pieces
if necessary for the purpose of the iteration exercises.
