# Introduction

## Agile Sprint Playbook

## Purpose
I conduct Agile Sprints loosely based on a variety of methodologies. 

The purpose of the Research and Design Sprint is to design and user test a minimal, but realistic prototype (that potentially solves a problem) without the time and expense of creating a full version. Depending on the results, the prototype may eventually be developed into a working product using Agile Project Management. 

The process can be a lot of fun :)

Continue on to the next chapter to see the results of some of my Research and Design Sprints, followed by my Agile Sprint Playbook.
