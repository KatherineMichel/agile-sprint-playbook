# Introduction

## Agile Sprint Playbook

## Purpose
I conduct Agile Sprints loosely based on a variety of methodologies, including Google Ventures [Research Sprint](http://www.gv.com/lib/the-gv-research-sprint-a-4-day-process-for-answering-important-startup-questions) and [Design Sprint](http://www.gv.com/sprint), and [thoughtbot Design Sprint](https://github.com/thoughtbot/design-sprint). 

The purpose of the Research and Design Sprint is to design and user test a minimal, but realistic prototype (that potentially solves a problem) without the time and expense of creating a full version.

The process can also be a lot of fun :)

Continue on to the next chapter to see the results of some of my Research and Design Sprints.
